Attendance Tracking Management System
Overview:
Attendance Tracking Management System (ATMS) is a part of an HR
System, that allows the Admin to track the attendance and leaving of the
employees, tracks their availability during the day, and managestheir profiles.
The leaving process is divided into two types of leaving:
• One that needs approval from the admin or the head of the department.
• One that is the ordinary leaving which does not need any approvals.
The Admin has all privileges to edit the employees’ data, and accept or reject
their leaving requests.
The Head of the Department is allowed to accept or reject his department
employees’ leaving requests
The Employee checks in, checks out, and requests leaving.
Types of Users:

❖ Leaving Requests Management
• Both admin and the head of the department can view the details of leaving
requests of the employees, either they were accepted or rejected.
• They can also view how many hours each month that the employee did not
attend before the end of the working day.
• when an employee applies for a leaving request the admin will be notified.
• The Employee will be notified about his leaving request Status
(Approved, Pending, Not Approved).
❖ Tracking Availability Management
• During the day, the system sends two requests to each employee, which
needs a response in 5 minutes. The request consists of a very simple
question (ex: How many legs does the cat have?) and the Employee must
answer this correctly
• If the request has no response or wrongly answered, a notification is sent
to the admin, telling him that the employee is not in the work.
• The requests are sent at a random time to the employees, not all the
employees at the same time, and the employee gets his requests at a
different time every day, and no one can know when the request will be
sent.
• This process happens to guarantee that every employee is in the work all
day.
• The Head of each department can hold a meeting for all of his employees
or some specific employees, and during the meeting, no requests can be
sent to the employees attending the meeting.
